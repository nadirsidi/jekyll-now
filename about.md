I am a detail-oriented engineer, with a drive for continuing education and a strong operations background. Over my career I have developed my data intuition, and I'm excited to apply that to data engineering projects. I enjoy learning about new technologies and being part of the growing data community. I especially enjoy the R user community and Python, particularly when deployed via Amazon Web Services abstracted services (i.e. serverless).

### My Current Role

In my current position at Enel X North America, I work on data engineering and application development. I collaborate closely with a data scientist and internal customers to understand business problems where we believe applying a model could either uncover opportunities for process improvement or better-inform decision making. Our specific problems involve energy usage and demand, building systems, and customer portfolios. Typically we are ingesting time-series data combined with series metadata to help our customers make smarter decisions about their energy consumption and costs. This has challenged me to learn about energy markets and the technical tools we need to leverage in order to deliver on our scope of work.   

### My Background

Like many people in the evolving data field, I have a unique background and I feel the skills I’ve learned in my career thus far can be applied broadly.

My experience in consulting allows me to quickly come up-to-speed on a client’s processes and speak in their vocabulary. In my experience, this is a critical skill set for understanding the context of available data, and collaboratively applying it to inform problems through analytics.

When I graduated from college, I had no experience in nuclear power, but after a year of intensive study and hard work, I qualified to teach Navy Officers and Sailors both the theory and operation of shipboard nuclear plants. I believe it is important to study the components of a system and system interfaces, in order to build a mental model of how a system works. By building accurate mental models, I am able to quickly learn and apply new systems effectively. The fields of data engineering and data science are advancing quickly, and keeping up requires the independent study I continue to demonstrate through resources like this blog.
